# Zerotier_controller
control whether Zerotier is running or not

This simple applet will determine if Zerotier is running and can either stop or start it.
I made this because I only needed Zerotier once a week, and didn't want it to run 24/7 otherwise.

To use this you simply need to place the reference script somewhere you like for example in your myDocuments folder.
Then keep the Run_ZeroTier handy somewhere like the desktop.

The Run script needs adjustment to point to your reference script. Then its as simple as double clicking on the Run script to actually run.
This process of having one reference the other prevents needing to override global script defaults which is risky.

Enjoy.
